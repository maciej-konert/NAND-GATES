# NAND-GATES
This is a C project for my Computer Architecture and Operating Systems class that I'm probably the proudest of. It was a real struggle to pull it off due to the harsh nature of C.
The task is translated in the .pdf file. Basically the program implements a dynamically loaded C library that lets you create boolean systems utilizing NAND gates.
